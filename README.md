# Lecture 13: Morphing

You can run the program on [GitHub pages](https://csci-4611-spring-2023.github.io/Lecture-13).

The latest commit is the finished code that was pushed at the end of class.  If you are intending to implement this program while watching the lecture video, you should checkout the commit labeled `pre-class commit`  to get the starter code.

## Prerequisites

To work with this code, you will first need to install [Node.js 18.13.0 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (or newer) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

## Running

You will need to set up the initial project by pulling the dependencies from the node package manager with:

```
npm install
```

After that, you can compile and run a server with:

```
npm run start
```

Your program should open in a web browser automatically.  If not, you can run it by pointing your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.
